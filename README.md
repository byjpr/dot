# My .files üè°

Just a personal backup of my MacBook Pro's setup. Certainly not a drop-in solution for anybody's machine except my own, but maybe a few lines will prove useful to you. 

(...in other words, after stealing so many sick bash hacks from people on here who are much smarter than me, I felt obligated to keep the repo public. And in even more words, ***use the automated scripts at your own risk!***)

All of the juicy stuff you're probably looking for is in [`zsh/aliases.zsh`](zsh/aliases.zsh) and [`zsh/functions.zsh`](zsh/functions.zsh) for my ZSH hacks, [`macos/defaults.sh`](macos/defaults.sh) for my macOS defaults, and [`Brewfile`](Brewfile) for my far-too-long list of binaries and apps I "need" installed. My [Firefox flags](firefox/user.js) and [VS Code preferences](vscode/) also live here.

Thanks for visiting, the `exit` is that way!
